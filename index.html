            <p> But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero. </p>

      <p> They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero. </p>
